      <li>What is an array?</li>
      <p>
        An array is a data structure that can store multiple values under a single name. Each value can be accessed by its index (position in the array), starting from zero.
        <br />
        Example: <code>let numbers = [1, 2, 3];</code>
      </p>
      <li>What does it mean to "hardcode" when we talk about programming?</li>
      <p>
        Hardcoding refers to embedding fixed values directly into the source code instead of dynamically generating or retrieving them during runtime. 
        <br />
        Example: <code>let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];</code>
      </p>
      <li>Explain in plain text what happens in Task 3, and how we can traverse (iterate) the array when we (humans) donâ€™t "know" how long the array is.</li>
      <p>
        In Task 3, the text string is converted into an array, with each word as an element. To traverse an array of unknown length, we use loops such as <code>for</code> or <code>forEach</code>. 
        <br />
        Example: 
        <code>
          for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) { console.log(array[i]); }
        </code>
      </p>
      <li>Why is it beneficial to store instances of a class in arrays, as in Task 4?</li>
      <p>
        Storing instances of a class in arrays allows us to organize and manipulate objects more efficiently. For example:
        <ul>
          <li>We can sort or filter objects based on attributes.</li>
          <li>Loops make it easy to apply operations to all instances.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <li>
        Try your best to explain the <code>EWeekDays</code> object from Task 7. How do we use the "value" attribute, for example? In what way do "WeekDay", "Workdays", and "Weekends" differ from each other? If we wanted to create a new element "WorkoutDays", which would contain "Monday", "Wednesday", and "Thursday", how would it ideally look?
      </li>
      <p>
        The <code>EWeekDays</code> object categorizes days into groups like "Workdays" and "Weekends" using keys. The "value" attribute retrieves the specific days in a group.
        <br />
        "WorkoutDays" could look like this:
        <code>
          WorkoutDays: { name: "Workout Days", days: ["Monday", "Wednesday", "Thursday"] }
        </code>
      </p>
      <li>In Task 8, we will use a "callback" routine when sorting. Explain how such a "callback" routine works.</li>
      <p>
        A callback function in sorting determines the order of elements. The function compares two elements and returns:
        <ul>
          <li>A negative value if the first element comes before the second.</li>
          <li>A positive value if the first element comes after the second.</li>
          <li>Zero if the elements are equal.</li>
        </ul>
        Example:
        <code>
          array.sort((a, b) => a - b); // Sorts numbers in ascending order.
        </code>
      </p>
      <li>
        What happens in the sorting routines you have created? Try to explain how the array can figure out if an element should come before or after another .
      </li>
