      <li>In part 1, is it possible to solve the problem using a single "for" loop?</li>
      <p>
        Yes, it is possible to solve Part 1 using a single "for" loop by iterating over the range of numbers and appending values for both counting up and counting down in the same loop. 
        <br />
        Example:
        <code>
          let countUp = ""; let countDown = ""; 
          for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) { countUp += i + " "; countDown = i + " " + countDown; }
        </code>
      </p>
      <li>In part 2, can we create what is known as an "infinite" loop within the condition of the "while" loop?</li>
      <p>
        Yes, an infinite loop can be created by ensuring the condition in the "while" loop always evaluates to true. For instance:
        <code>
          while (true) { /* Code runs indefinitely */ }
        </code>
        <br />
        However, infinite loops must include a condition or "break" statement to prevent the program from crashing. Example:
        <code>
          while (true) { if (someCondition) break; }
        </code>
      </p>
      <li>
        Discuss briefly how quickly or slowly a computer might compute this, considering the number of guesses and the time it takes. How does the program behave while it is guessing? Can the program perform other tasks concurrently?
      </li>
      <p>
        - The time to compute depends on the range of numbers being guessed. Smaller ranges (e.g., 1 to 60) are quick, while larger ranges (e.g., 1 to 1,000,000) take longer.
        <br />
        - The program runs synchronously, so it focuses solely on the guessing process and cannot perform other tasks concurrently unless multithreading (e.g., Web Workers) is used.
      </p>
      <li>
        Explain the relationship between rows and columns in nested "for" loops. Can we, for instance, change the order, considering rows to be innermost or columns to be innermost, or does this not matter?
      </li>
      <p>
        The order of nested loops determines how rows and columns are processed:
        <br />
        - **Rows Outer, Columns Inner**: Processes one row at a time, completing all columns before moving to the next row.
        <br />
        - **Columns Outer, Rows Inner**: Processes one column at a time, completing all rows before moving to the next column.
        <br />
        While the order of processing differs, the result is equivalent if data is organized accordingly .
