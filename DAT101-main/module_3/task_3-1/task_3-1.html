      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1. What happens when the wake-up time is not 7, and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>
        If the wake-up time is not 7, the program outputs "Not the right time!" indicating that the condition is not met. 
        When the wake-up time is exactly 7, the program outputs "Perfect! Wake-up time is 7!" confirming that the condition is satisfied.
      </p>
      <li>Same as question #1, but for part 2. Discuss the behavior of part 2. What happens when the wake-up time is not 7, and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>
        In part 2, if the wake-up time is not 7, the program outputs a custom message like "Close, but not 7." 
        If the wake-up time is exactly 7, it displays "You hit the exact wake-up time!" showing that the program recognizes the exact condition.
      </p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3. What happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>
        If the wake-up time is less than 7, the program outputs "Too early!" indicating the time is too soon.
        If the wake-up time is greater than 8, the program outputs "Too late!" indicating the time is past the acceptable range.
        Wake-up times between 7 and 8 might display a neutral or specific message, depending on the implementation.
      </p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 4. What happens if the number is exactly 0? Is zero positive or negative?</li>
      <p>
        If the number is exactly 0, the program might output "Zero is neither positive nor negative." This reflects that zero is treated as a special case in mathematics , neither belonging to positive nor negative categories.
